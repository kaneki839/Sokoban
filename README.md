# Sokoban
It's a game where you would have the character, and your goal is to push the box onto the target, then you win. You can move your character up, down, left, and right. You can achieve this action by using w,s,a,d on your keyboard. The gameboard was created to visualize how game would look like, but if you wish, you could create your own customized gameboard.
